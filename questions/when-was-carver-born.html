                <h2>The Mystery of Carver's Birth Date</h2>
                <p>George Washington Carver was born <strong>around 1864</strong> near Diamond Grove, Missouri (now simply Diamond, Missouri). His exact birth date is unknown because he was born into slavery, and enslaved people's birth dates were rarely recorded.</p>

                <p>Historians estimate his birth year based on historical records, but the specific month and day have never been determined. Some sources suggest January 1864, while others place his birth sometime between 1861 and 1865.</p>

                <h2>Why the Exact Date is Unknown</h2>
                <p>Several factors explain why Carver's birth date remains a mystery:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Slavery practices:</strong> Enslaved people were often not given birth certificates or recorded in official records</li>
                    <li><strong>Property records:</strong> Enslaved people were typically recorded as property, listing only approximate ages</li>
                    <li><strong>Civil War chaos:</strong> Born during the Civil War, many records from this period were lost or never created</li>
                    <li><strong>Early kidnapping:</strong> Carver and his mother were kidnapped by Confederate raiders when he was an infant, further complicating his early records</li>

                <h2>Raised by the Carvers</h2>
                <p>After being recovered from the kidnappers, George and his brother James were raised by Moses and Susan Carver. Though the Civil War ended slavery, the Carvers raised the boys as their own children, giving George the education and encouragement that would shape his future.</p>

                <p>Young George showed an early fascination with plants and became known locally as "the plant doctor" for his ability to nurse sick plants back to health.</p>
