                <h2>A Man of Deep Faith</h2>
                <p><strong>George Washington Carver was a devout Christian</strong> throughout his life. His faith was not separate from his scientific work - it was the foundation of it. He saw studying nature as a way to understand God's creation and believed that his discoveries were divine revelations.</p>
                <p>Carver attended church regularly, taught Sunday school, and spoke openly about his faith in lectures and writings. He considered his scientific abilities a gift from God, meant to be used in service to others.</p>

                "I love to think of nature as an unlimited broadcasting station, through which God speaks to us every hour, if we will only tune in."

                <h2>Science as Worship</h2>
                <p>Carver famously described his laboratory as "God's Little Workshop." He believed that when he worked with plants, he was uncovering secrets that God had hidden in nature for humanity to discover. This wasn't metaphorical - Carver genuinely believed God guided his research.</p>
                <p>He often rose before dawn to walk in the woods and pray before beginning his laboratory work. He said these morning conversations with God helped him know which experiments to conduct and how to interpret his results.</p>

                <h2>Religious Practice</h2>
                <p>Carver was raised by Moses and Susan Carver, who exposed him to Christianity. As an adult, he maintained active church membership and taught Bible classes at Tuskegee for many years. His Sunday evening Bible classes were popular among students.</p>
                <p>He avoided denominational labels but was associated with Presbyterian and Methodist churches at various points in his life. His faith was personal and practical rather than theological or dogmatic.</p>

                <h2>Faith and Service</h2>
                <p>Carver saw his work helping poor farmers as fulfilling Christ's command to serve others. He believed God had given him scientific abilities specifically so he could use them to help those in need. This explains why he refused to patent most of his discoveries - he felt they belonged to God and humanity, not to him.</p>
