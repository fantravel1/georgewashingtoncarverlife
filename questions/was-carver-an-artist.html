                <h2>Art at Simpson College</h2>
                <p>When Carver enrolled at Simpson College in 1890, he majored in art. His teacher, Etta Budd, was impressed by his talent, particularly his paintings of plants and flowers. She noticed that his botanical paintings showed exceptional scientific understanding.</p>
                <p>It was Budd who suggested Carver switch to agriculture, reasoning that while he could succeed as an artist, he could help more people as a scientist. Carver took her advice but kept painting.</p>
