                <h2>A Life Dedicated to Service</h2>
                <p><strong>No, George Washington Carver never married and had no children.</strong> He devoted his entire life to his work, his students, and his faith. His "family" consisted of his students at Tuskegee, many of whom he mentored for decades.</p>
                <p>Carver lived simply in a dormitory room on the Tuskegee campus for most of his 47 years there, surrounded by his plants, paintings, and scientific specimens rather than family.</p>

                <h2>Why He Never Married</h2>
                <p>Historians have offered several explanations for Carver's bachelor life:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Total dedication to work:</strong> Carver worked long hours in his laboratory, often until late at night</li>
                    <li><strong>Spiritual calling:</strong> He saw his scientific work as a form of divine service</li>
                    <li><strong>His students as family:</strong> He considered his students his children and devoted himself to their success</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple lifestyle:</strong> He lived very frugally and may have felt he couldn't support a family</li>
                    <li><strong>Early trauma:</strong> Losing his mother as an infant may have affected his ability to form close attachments</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="answer-section">
                <h2>His Extended Family</h2>
                <p>While Carver had no spouse or children, he maintained connections with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>His brother James:</strong> Who remained in Missouri</li>
                    <li><strong>Students:</strong> Many whom he mentored throughout their careers</li>
                    <li><strong>Colleagues:</strong> Close professional relationships with scientists and educators</li>
                    <li><strong>Henry Ford:</strong> Became a close friend in Carver's final years</li>
