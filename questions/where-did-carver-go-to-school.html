                <h2>A Long Road to Education</h2>
                <p><strong>George Washington Carver's educational journey was remarkable</strong>, spanning multiple states and taking nearly three decades from his first school to his master's degree. As a formerly enslaved Black man, he faced rejection, financial hardship, and discrimination at every turn.</p>
                <p>His determination to learn drove him to walk miles to attend schools that would accept Black students, work as a farmhand and launderer to pay his way, and ultimately become one of the most educated African Americans of his era.</p>

                <h2>Early Education in Missouri and Kansas</h2>
                <p>When Carver was about 12 years old, he left the Carver farm because the local school wouldn't accept Black students. He walked 8 miles to Neosho, Missouri, to attend a school for African American children run by Andrew and Mariah Watkins.</p>
                <p>Over the next decade, Carver moved through several Kansas towns including Fort Scott, Olathe, Paola, and Minneapolis, attending schools when possible while working as a farmhand, cook, and launderer to support himself.</p>

                <h2>The Highland College Rejection</h2>
                <p>In 1885, Carver was accepted to Highland College in Kansas based on his written application. However, when he arrived and the administrators saw he was Black, they refused to honor the acceptance. This devastating rejection delayed his college education by five years.</p>

                <h2>Simpson College</h2>
                <p>In 1890, Carver finally entered college at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, where he was the second Black student. He studied art and piano, supporting himself by doing laundry for other students. His art teacher, Etta Budd, recognized his talent for painting plants and encouraged him to pursue botany.</p>

                <h2>Iowa State Agricultural College</h2>
                <p>Following Etta Budd's advice, Carver transferred to Iowa State Agricultural College (now Iowa State University) in 1891. He became the first African American student at the institution. He excelled academically, earned both bachelor's and master's degrees, and was asked to stay on as the first Black faculty member.</p>
