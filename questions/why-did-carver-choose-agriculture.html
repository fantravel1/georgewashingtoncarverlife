                <h2>From Art to Agriculture</h2>
                <p><strong>George Washington Carver originally wanted to be an artist.</strong> He enrolled at Simpson College in Iowa in 1890 to study art and piano. However, his art teacher recognized that his true genius lay elsewhere - and convinced him to pursue agriculture instead.</p>
                <p>This pivotal decision would change the course of American agricultural history and help millions of struggling farmers.</p>

                <h2>The Influence of Etta Budd</h2>
                <p>At Simpson College, Carver's art teacher Etta Budd noticed something remarkable: his paintings of plants showed an extraordinary understanding of botanical structures. She saw that he didn't just paint plants - he understood them intimately.</p>
                <p>Budd advised Carver that while he could certainly become a successful artist, he could help far more people by studying agriculture. Her father, Joseph Budd, was a professor at Iowa State Agricultural College, and she encouraged Carver to transfer there.</p>

                <h2>A Higher Calling</h2>
                <p>Carver embraced agriculture not just as a career, but as a mission. He believed God had given him his gifts to help others, particularly the impoverished Black farmers of the South who were struggling after the end of slavery.</p>
                <p>He often spoke of his work in spiritual terms, seeing the study of plants as a way to understand divine creation and use that knowledge to serve humanity.</p>

            <section class="answer-section">
                <h2>The Need Was Great</h2>
                <p>In the late 1800s, Southern agriculture was in crisis. The soil was exhausted from generations of cotton monoculture. Black sharecroppers were trapped in poverty, growing crops that depleted the land further while earning barely enough to survive.</p>
                <p>Carver saw agricultural science as a tool for liberation - if he could teach farmers better methods and develop new uses for alternative crops, he could help lift millions out of poverty.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="answer-section">
                <h2>He Never Forgot Art</h2>
                <p>Though Carver chose agriculture, he never abandoned art. Throughout his life, he continued to paint, primarily flowers and plants. His work was exhibited and admired. He also taught art at Tuskegee alongside his agricultural courses.</p>
                <p>In the end, Carver found a way to combine both passions - his botanical illustrations helped farmers identify plants and diseases, and his artistic eye informed his approach to scientific work.</p>
