                <h2>Indifferent to Wealth</h2>
                <p><strong>George Washington Carver was famously indifferent to money.</strong> Despite his fame and the commercial value of his discoveries, he lived frugally, refused salary increases, turned down lucrative corporate offers, and donated most of his earnings to charity.</p>
                <p>When he died, his life savings of approximately $60,000 went to establish the George Washington Carver Foundation for agricultural research at Tuskegee.</p>

                <h2>His Tuskegee Salary</h2>
                <p>When Carver arrived at Tuskegee in 1896, his starting salary was $1,500 per year - a decent sum at the time, especially with room and board included. Over his 47 years at the institution, his salary increased only modestly.</p>
                <p>He repeatedly refused raises, telling administrators that the money should go to the school instead. Even when his fame brought opportunities for much higher pay elsewhere, he chose to stay at Tuskegee at his modest salary.</p>

                <h2>Why He Didn't Profit</h2>
                <p>Carver held only three patents despite hundreds of discoveries. He believed his findings belonged to God and humanity, not to him personally. He refused to patent products that could help poor farmers, reasoning that patents would restrict access to those who needed them most.</p>
                <p>He also refused most consulting fees and speaking honoraria, or donated them immediately to Tuskegee or charity.</p>

                <h2>Simple Living</h2>
                <p>Carver's indifference to money was genuine. He lived in a small room at Tuskegee, owned few clothes (often wearing the same suit for years), and had minimal possessions. He saw no need for material comforts beyond the basics.</p>
                <p>Colleagues sometimes found uncashed salary checks in his desk drawers - he simply forgot to deposit them.</p>

                <h2>His Legacy Gift</h2>
                <p>Despite his simple lifestyle, Carver managed to save approximately $60,000 over his lifetime (equivalent to over $1 million today). In 1940, he donated his entire life savings to establish the George Washington Carver Foundation at Tuskegee to continue agricultural research.</p>
                <p>When he died in 1943, he had given away virtually everything he owned. His will left his remaining possessions - mostly specimens, papers, and a few personal items - to the foundation.</p>
