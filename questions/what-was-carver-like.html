                <h2>A Unique Personality</h2>
                <p><strong>George Washington Carver was known for his gentle, humble demeanor</strong> and eccentric habits. Those who met him often remarked on his soft, high-pitched voice, his simple dress, and his seemingly endless patience with students and visitors alike.</p>
                <p>He was a complex man - brilliant yet humble, famous yet indifferent to fame, capable of great achievements yet content with a simple life.</p>

                <h2>Physical Appearance</h2>
                <p>Carver was slender and of average height, with distinctive features shaped by the childhood illness that had nearly killed him. He had a high-pitched, somewhat falsetto voice - the result of the whooping cough he survived as an infant during his kidnapping.</p>
                <p>He was known for always wearing a flower in his lapel and for his increasingly worn suits. He owned very few clothes and saw no reason to replace garments that still functioned.</p>

            <section class="answer-section">
                <h2>Simple Lifestyle</h2>
                <p>Despite his fame, Carver lived in a small room on the Tuskegee campus for decades. He owned few possessions and gave away most of his money. He never owned a car and cared little for material comforts.</p>
                <p>When visitors expressed surprise at his modest accommodations, Carver would simply say he had everything he needed. His needs were few: his laboratory, his plants, his Bible, and his students.</p>

            <section class="answer-section">
                <h2>Daily Habits</h2>
                <p>Carver rose before dawn - often at 4 AM - to take walks in the woods around Tuskegee. He called these his "nature walks" and used them for prayer and observation. He collected specimens and claimed these morning walks were when God revealed scientific insights to him.</p>
                <p>He ate simply, often just one or two meals a day, and avoided meat for long periods. He was known to become so absorbed in his work that he forgot to eat entirely.</p>

            <section class="answer-section">
                <h2>With Students</h2>
                <p>Carver was beloved by students for his patience and accessibility. He would spend hours explaining concepts, showing visitors around his laboratory, and answering questions from anyone who asked. He had no children of his own but mentored countless young people.</p>
                <p>He taught Bible classes on Sunday evenings that were popular among students, and he maintained correspondence with former students throughout their lives.</p>
